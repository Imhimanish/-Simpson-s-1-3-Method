Integration of Function (Numerical methods) 

Simpson's rule is one of the formulas used to find the approximate value of a definite integral. 
Simpson's rule is used to find the value of a definite integral (that is of the form b
∫ₐ f(x) dx) by 
approximating the area under the graph of the function f(x). 
If we have f(x) = y, which is equally spaced between [a,b], the Simpson's rule formula is:
 b
∫a f(x) d x ≈ (h/3) [f(x0)+4 f(x1)+2 f(x2)+ ... +2 f(xn-2)+4 f(xn-1)+f(xn)]
